-	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is like organizing your code in a way that makes it easier to understand and reuse. Imagine we have different types of things objects in our program, like cars, animals, or shapes. OOP helps by putting similar things together in groups classes. Each group (class) has its own unique features and actions. For example, a class for cars can have features like color and speed, and actions like starting and stopping. OOP also lets one group of things class share features and actions with another. So, if we have a general class for vehicles, it can share common features and actions with more specific classes like cars or bikes. This makes our code more organized, easy to update, and helps avoid doing the same work over and over.
